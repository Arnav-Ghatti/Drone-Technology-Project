                <h3>Professional Photography and Videography</h3>
                <p>This is one area where drones have been quickly embraced and are actively used. The entertainment industry and photographers at different levels of learning are using drones to capture beautiful scenes and moments. Many news companies are choosing drones to photograph disaster struck areas where it may not be feasible to send a person. The 2016 Rio Olympic Games used drones for photographing and filming many major events. Other events like PGA US Open and X Games have used drones for capturing photos and making videos too. Instagram accounts like @droneoftheday, @airpixels, and @skynamicdrone provide users with some of the most amazing drone photographs showing how much drones can achieve in this area.</p>

                <h3>Agriculture</h3>
                <p>Drones are a farmer’s friend in more ways than one. Most farms are spread over many acres of land and farmers spend a lot of time trying to survey the farms for drainage or irrigation problems, diseases affecting the plants, the growth rate of the crops, and checking the soil quality. Drones are capable of doing all of this work and much more. This makes them very suitable for farmers. Some drone startups are even beginning to trial the use of drones for planting the crops. Drones can also spray the crops with necessary insecticides or pesticides and they can spray nutrients to the ground quickly and very easily. The whole process is completed in less time making it more viable for farmers. They can also be used to keep an eye on the farm animals when they go out to graze.</p>

            <div class="section" id="use3">
                <h3>Surveillance and Security</h3>
                <p>Drones have the ability to strengthen a surveillance team’s ability to cover more area in less time and with higher accuracy. They can be used for surveying large festival areas or for countering illegal drug operations. Many private homes are also considering the use of drones for surveillance around the perimeter of the house. The Police and Border Guard (PPA) in Estonia recently ordered 9 drones which will be used for keeping an eye on the border. They aim at reducing incidents at the border and quickly reacting to any situations arising in the border areas. They can also be used for monitoring and countering illegal activities like human trafficking. Fire departments have been using drones to survey regions affected by wildfires too.</p>

            <div class="section" id="use4">
                <h3>Delivering Products</h3>
                <p>Amazon used its Prime Air Delivery service to fulfill a customer order in the UK using a drone. Domino’s also made it to the news when it delivered a pizza with the help of a drone in New Zealand. California-based company, Zipline, is working in collaboration with African governments to deliver blood supplies to remote areas clinics. Maersk Tankers used a drone to send supplies to a ship off the coast of Denmark. Drone deliveries in USA are still limited because of strict FAA regulations. However, there are 6 regions in the US which enjoy some flexibility in the rules as they are considered as “Designated Test Sites”. Nevada is one of these regions. 7-Eleven partnered with the drone company, Flirtey to deliver donuts and a slurpee to a customer in Nevada. Private companies as well as government authorities are conducting research and beginning trials to deliver products using drones. This application of drones is still to be researched and has a lot of growth opportunities.</p>

                <h3>Drones in The Military</h3>
                <p>Drones were created mainly for military purposes. Their use in all other areas that we have discussed above is but secondary. Countries at war have been using drones for a substantial period of time dating back as early as World War I. Drones made a lot of sense in wars given the fact that the life of pilots don’t have to be risked. Today, drones are available in many forms and sizes and are used by numerous countries around the world. They have played a role in predicting conflicts and also in helping countries fight wars with fewer casualties.</p>
